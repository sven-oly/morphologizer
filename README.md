# morphologizer
A general morphologizer program in Python3, started in February 2023.

# A program for creating morphology in human languages.

## First implementation:
[morphonogizer for Cherokee](https://morphologizer-395504.appspot.com/)

## Planned features:
* Multiple language support based on locale id, e.g., 'fr', 'es', 'ff', 'chr'
* Conjugation of verbs:
  * Create verb forms based on the verb root, person, number, tense, mode, etc.
* Supports characters written in any Unicode script
* Support personal and impersonal pronouns as subjects
* Represent and inflect noun classes including number, gender, etc.
* Inflect adjectives associated with nouns

## First attempt:
* Support verb conjugation, including regular and irregular forms for French and German languages
* Include many common verbs including "to be", "to have", "to eat", "to do", "to see", "to sleep"
# Provide a command line interface with python3
* Incorporate pronomial / reflexive verbs such as "se reveiller" (to wake up, 'fr')

## Next plans for language:
* Add web-based interface with controls to specify parameters
* Add support for Fula verbs and noun classes using both Latin and Adlam characters
* Extend to additional languages
* Add more morphology as needed

## Help wanted / needed
I am not a linguist but rather a programming geek. I welcome and encourage advice and help in building this.

I work with TranslationCommons.org and endangeredlanguages.com, organizations which work with many language communities who wish to enhance
the use and utility of their languages and cultures. Their work includes basic language technology and standards as well as training and
building tools and databases for languages that may have fewer resources than dominant languages.
